# Old SSF2 Overlays
This repository holds released old and obsolete stream overlays used on *Super Smash Flash 2* (and other fighting game) broadcasts produced by The Lab Creatives (CX) and later by Aftermath Creative Production (ACX). Overlays appear in this repository two years after the overlay's end of life (usually the start of the next ACX Season), with some special exceptions.

Branding and proprietary code has been removed or replaced with generics for compliance with reasonable use policies. Fonts are also not included, though fonts used are noted in the README for each overlay (if I remember what they are).

While the intent to releasing these overlays is to foster creativity and aid in creating fresh new overlays, they are all released under the MIT License (see LICENSE), which means that they can be used verbatim.

## How to use this repository
Each overlay can be found in one of the folders above. A README for each overlay is included which includes information about the overlay, such as when it was used, what is required to use it, and a screenshot of the overlay being used on a real broadcast, if applicable.

## Overlays before 2021
Overlays created before 2021 (v4 to v12.1) use an obsolete paid tool called [Scoreboard Assistant](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/scoreboard-assistant.112/). With the exception of the v12.1 CoreOverlay port, none of the pre-2021 overlays have been ported to CoreOverlay and will need this tool to use unmodified.

Overlays created in 2021 and later (v12.1 and later) are built on some version of [CoreOverlay](https://github.com/doqfgc/CoreOverlay) and can work unmodified.

## Overlays before 2017
Overlays created before 2017 ("Old Overlay" series and v1/v2) were imagestacks maintained manually without any tools. There is also no guarantee that everything will be present, and the quality is so spotty that they have been omitted from the repository.

v3 is missing.

## Using via GitHub Pages

On most CoreOverlay-based overlay packages, you can use the GitHub Pages url directly as a browser source in OBS. Navigate to the desired version and copy the URL into OBS's browser source configuration. The required fonts will still need to be installed system-side.
