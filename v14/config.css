    THE LAB CREATIVES

    most common colour names work, along with the following formats:
    #RRGGBB hex code
    #RRGGBBAA adds alpha transparency
    rgb(red, green, blue) - where red, green, and blue are between 0 and 255
    rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) - same as above, except alpha is between 0.0 and 1.0
    hsl(hue, sat, lum) - if you're WEIRD, also hsla(hue, sat, lum, alpha)

    generally only black, white look good for colour names; use a format for others

    modifying anything but the values themselves may have unintended side effects or even completely break the overlay.
